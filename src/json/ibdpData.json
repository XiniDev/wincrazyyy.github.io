Winson is very familiar with the IBDP exam details, including all the past papers questioning styles, exam techniques, and key points. He is an excellent tutor who knows how to customize an appropriate learning plan. He quickly spotted my weaknesses and trained me with past papers. All I had to do was follow his plan and finish his assigned homework. Winson also provided his own notes by sorting and organizing important concepts in a methodical and logical manner. I got the chance to learn quickly and systematically, all by heart. When I was taking my final IBDP exam, I understood all the questions and thus felt confident. Within only 3 months, I successfully increased my Math HL grade from 3 to 6.",
