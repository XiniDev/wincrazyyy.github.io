Before I met him, mathematics was my worst subject and I remembered hating every second of it in class. But ever since year 9 when I went to him for tuition, things have significantly changed for the better as I made tremendous progress by learning his ways of tackling specific problems and putting in a lot of effort. Not only did I find a new sense of purpose in doing math, but I even began to enjoy it, all because of Mr. Siu’s unique way of teaching, which is learning the key concepts of each topic and applying this knowledge to past-paper questions. This is a very efficient way of learning and I really do appreciate having lessons with Mr. Siu.",
